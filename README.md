# Oxynum Studio - Project Test üèÜ
##### Hey you ! 
If you are consulting this file, it's because you met someone from our team ‚ù§Ô∏è and you are ready to take on the challenge to be a new team member. So... How about we get started ?

## Presentation

The purpose in this challenge is to work directly on a little project. So you will start from nothing, with your best IDE, and will put online a beautiful and awesome application. 

You will have to choose **3 topics** from the list below. Chose topics in which you are the most comfortable! The goal is to show your skills in each of the topic you will tackle.

## Topics list

So now you need to choose 3 topics inside this list.

- Styling - CSS3 / SCSS / LESS
- Javascript - VanillaJS (ES5/ES6)
- Framework JS - VueJS, ReactJS, Angular... Others ?
- Docker
- Back-end (PHP, Ruby, Python, C#, JAVA, NodeJS ... ?)
- UI/UX
- Relational databases
- NoSQL Databases
- AWS
- Firebase
- Architecture
- CI / CD
- GIT

## First thing to do - Prepare code delivery

Whether you're on mac, windows, linux... 

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a folder in which you will start to work, and name it **oxynum-project-yourname**. Know that this folder will be sent to the Team later to be reviewed in **.zip** file!
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `skills.txt` file inside this folder and place the topic you chosed:

### Example: *skills.txt*

```
UI/UX
Javascript ES6 + Framework JS VueJS
Firebase
```

- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a **project** folder inside **oxynum-project-yourname**. This is where your code will be.

Now the folder is ready to be delivered once you finish the project üòé

## Get to know the challenge.

You will have to create a tool called **SmartUp**. A smart, small, powerful little application that can help you handle your incomes ! Some functionnalities are viral for the app, choose the one you want to implement.

### üëåüèªCreate a profile, with email and password
Here you can create a profile and log into the app with your password and email. You can use a service to log in or fake a login inside your app. The app must display the user name once logged.

### ‚úÖ Add/delete/modify (CRUD) an income to your monthly incomes.
You must be able to create an income and to add it to the list of incomes linked to the profile. An income can be modified or deleted.

### ü§õüèΩ See the total amount of incomes that you earned monthly or yearly
You should be able to consult the total amount of incomes that you earned on your profile.

### Navigate inside the app via a menu
You can create a menu to navigate between several tabs of the app.

### You are free on the design
Don't waste too much time on it, we want something that works in terms of features. We are mostly evaluating the code.

## Code Evaluation

The points that you will read here concerns the reviewing of your project.

### Mobile First
The app must be thought in a **Mobile First** way (not Mobile Only!). CSS mut be responsive ! You can use a library UI like Bootstrap or Bulma.

### Free on the technology you choose

You are free to use any tool, framework, library you want, however be sure to use it well ! We will review your code and also your productivity.

- Using GIT is a PLUS
- Using DOCKER is a PLUS

### Deploy it on Surge üö®

You can deploy your app on [Surge](https://surge.sh/). So we can directly see it online.

### You MUST make a nice documentation

We will launch your app is order to see if it works or no. The documentation must be clear and organised like below:

- Create a README.md inside the **project** folder.
- Write in it, installation of the project
- How to launch the project

‚ö†Ô∏è If the project cannot be launched, you will unfortunately fail this challenge. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Ok... Now are you ready ? Open your IDE, and let's go ;)

Good luck for the Studio challenge ! Once you are done send your work in a .zip file: **oxynum-project-yourname.zip** ! Or simply put you rwork on YOUR github and send us the link. We will review it and sending you feedbacks !

Thanks, and again, good luck !

## Last but not least

If you have any remaining questions prior to starting to code, do ask them, no question is stupid, and it will be too late once you submit your project.
